## Notes
Bootstrap has all a beginner needs to create a dynamic webpage. Inserting JavaScript is optional.

Rules to manipulate the format for Bootstrap Carousel:

1. Use the complete code given to you first.
2. Identify what you want to change in the code. In this example, we are changing the height of the carousel.
3. Know what to change. Rule of thumb is that you do not change the classes within Bootstrap's code.
